    <h1>State of Grace</h1>
    <h2 class="anim three">[Verse 1]</h2>
    <p>I'm walking fast through the traffic lights Busy streets and busy lives And all we know is touch and go We are alone with our changing minds We fall in love 'til it hurts or <span class="bigger">bleeds</span> Or fades in time [Chorus] And I never <strong>(Never)</strong> Saw you coming And I'll never <strong>(Never)</strong> Be the same <h2>[Verse 2]</h2> You come around and the armor falls Pierce the room like a cannonball Now all we know is <em>don't let go</em> We are alone, just you and me Up in your room and our slates are clean Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes</p>
    <h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
    <p>So you were never a <span class="highlight">saint</span> And I've loved in shades of wrong We learn to live with the <span class="highlight">pain</span> Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild</p>
    [Chorus] And I never (Never) Saw you coming And I'll never (Never) Be the same
    <h2>[Bridge]</h2>
    This is a <span class="write-rl">state of grace</span> This is the worthwhile fight Love is a <span class="bigger">ruthless</span> game Unless you play it good and right These are the hands of fate You're my Achilles heel This is the golden age Of something good and right and real [Chorus] And I never (Never) Saw you coming And I'll never Be the same [Chorus] And I never <strong>(Never)</strong> Saw you coming And I'll never (So you were never a <span class="highlight">saint</span>) (And I've loved in shades of wrong) Be the same (We learn to live with the <span class="highlight">pain</span>) (Mosaic broken hearts) (But this love is brave and wild) [Outro] This is a <span class="write-rl">state of grace</span> This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right.
